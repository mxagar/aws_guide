# A Guide to Amazon Web Services (AWS): Fundamentals, Architecture, Data Science

In this repository I collect my notes on the different services provided by Cloud Platform Amazon Web Services (AWS).

I have structured the project in the following sections:

- [`01_cloud_practitioner/`](./01_cloud_practitioner/): Contents for the [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) exam. Created mainly after following the Udemy tutorial/course by Stephane Maarek [Ultimate AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new) and the Datacamp courses [Introduction to AWS](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-aws) and [Introduction to AWS Boto in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-aws-boto-in-python).
- [02_mlops_aws](./02_mlops_aws): This guide started as a collection of notes after following the cohort-based course [Machine Learning School](https://svpino.gumroad.com/l/mlp) by [Santiago Valdarrama](https://twitter.com/svpino), focusing on AWS services.
- [`03_aws_good_parts`](./03_aws_good_parts/): These are my personal notes of the book [The Good Parts of AWS](https://dvassallo.gumroad.com/l/aws-good-parts) by Daniel Vassallo and Josh Pschorr.
- [`04_solutions_architect/`](./02_solutions_architect/): Contents for the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/es/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) exam.
