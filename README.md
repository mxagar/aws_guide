# Amazon Web Services (AWS) Solutions Architect Guide

This repository contains my personal notes on the AWS platform.

Most notes are based on the contents provided by the Coursera/AWS specialization [AWS Cloud Solutions Architect Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/aws-cloud-solutions-architect). That Professional Certificae prepares for the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/).

The guide is structured in the following subfolders:

- [`01_cloud_technical_essentials/`](./01_cloud_technical_essentials/): [AWS Cloud Technical Essentials](https://www.coursera.org/learn/aws-cloud-technical-essentials).
- [`02_architecting_solutions/`](./02_architecting_solutions/): [Architecting Solutions on AWS](https://www.coursera.org/learn/architecting-solutions-on-aws).
- [`03_intro_data_lakes/`](./03_intro_data_lakes/): [Introduction to Designing Data Lakes on AWS](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-designing-data-lakes-in-aws).
