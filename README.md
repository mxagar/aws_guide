# A Guide to Amazon Web Services (AWS): Fundamentals, Development, Data Science

In this repository I collect my notes on the different services provided by Cloud Platform Amazon Web Services (AWS).

I have structured the project in the following sections:

- [`01_cloud_practitioner/`](./01_cloud_practitioner/): Contents for the [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) exam. Created after following the Udemy tutorial/course by Stephane Maarek [Ultimate AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new).
- [`02_solutions_architect/`](./02_solutions_architect/): Contents for the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/es/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) exam.
